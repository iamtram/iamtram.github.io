## Dynamic Wind Simulation in Multimodal Interaction

WindyWall is a creative platform for dynamic wind simulation.

### Motivation
Haptic feelings are important in Immersive experiences. However, haptic experiences have been narrowly confined to vibrational feeling of handheld devices. Ambience factors such as thermal and wind need to be conveyed, yet we do not have a good understanding of how human perceive these factors objectively. Hence, we created a platform to simulate wind and conduct studies to understand human perception of it.

### Platform
We created 3 panel of 5x6 modular fans to cover a wide angle of 120 degree surrounding a player. The fans can be controlled singularly or together, synchronised by different timing patterns. The idea is to simulate different wind conditions and patterns that are not feasible with other platforms. The player can feel a gush of wind, a bus rushing by, a sudden blow of wind, or gentle rolling breeze.

### Study
We conducted
